Social Media Platform with Spring Boot
This repository contains the source code for a simple yet comprehensive social media platform built using Spring Boot. The project showcases a RESTful API design, providing endpoints for user management, posting content, commenting, and interacting with posts. It's designed to demonstrate key features of Spring Boot, including:

CRUD Operations: Implementations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users, posts, and comments, utilizing Spring Data JPA.
Caching: Usage of Spring's caching capabilities to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data.
Exception Handling: A global exception handling mechanism to manage errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the API consumers.
External API Interaction: Demonstrates how to consume external APIs and cache their responses for efficient data retrieval.
Data Validation: Ensures the integrity of incoming data through custom validators.
Swagger Documentation: Integrated Swagger for API documentation, making it easier to test and interact with the API endpoints.
In-Memory Database: Utilizes H2, an in-memory database, for quick setup and demonstration purposes, with Hibernate for ORM.
